I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the Federal University of Paran√° and a Master's degree from the Federal Fluminense University. My research interests span particle physics, nonlinear dynamics, and computational methods, particularly machine learning applications in physical systems. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at McMaster University under the group of Professor [Rodrigo Alejandro Vargas-Hernandez](https://chemai-lab.com/), focusing on theoretical chemistry and advanced computational techniques. My work aims to bridge physics and chemistry through innovative approaches in quantum systems and machine learning."

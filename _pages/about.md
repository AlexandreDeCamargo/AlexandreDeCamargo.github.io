I am a physicist with a Bachelor’s degree from the Federal University of Paraná and a Master’s degree from the Federal Fluminense University. My academic journey has been driven by a passion for understanding fundamental physical phenomena, with research interests spanning particle physics, nonlinear dynamics, and computational methods. I am particularly fascinated by the application of machine learning to solve complex problems in physical systems. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at McMaster University as part of Professor [Rodrigo Alejandro Vargas-Hernandez](https://chemai-lab.com/) research group, where I focus on theoretical chemistry and advanced computational techniques. My work seeks to bridge the gap between physics and chemistry by developing innovative approaches to study quantum systems using machine learning, contributing to the growing field of computational science.

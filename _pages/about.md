I am a physicist with a Bachelor’s degree from the Federal University of Paraná and a Master’s degree from the Federal Fluminense University. My academic journey has been driven by a passion for understanding fundamental physical phenomena, with research interests spanning particle physics, nonlinear dynamics, and computational methods. I am particularly fascinated by the application of machine learning to solve complex problems in physical systems. 

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at McMaster University as part of Professor [Rodrigo Alejandro Vargas-Hernandez](https://chemai-lab.com/) research group, where I focus on theoretical chemistry and advanced computational techniques. My currently work focus on the development of machine learning models for quantum many-body physics.
